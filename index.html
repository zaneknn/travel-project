                    <h3>The Land of Promise</h3>
                    <p>Palawan is an archipelagic province of the Philippines, and occupies the western edge of the
                        country.
                        It
                        lies between
                        the South Sea China in the northwest, the Sulu Sea in the southeast, Mindoro Island to the
                        northeast,
                        and Borneo to the
                        southwest. Part of the Mimaropa Region and belonging to the Luzon Group of Islands, Palawan is a
                        pristine area that
                        counts no less than 1,780 islands and islets, where you can find stunning beaches and lagoons
                        that
                        are
                        relatively
                        untouched by modern development.</p>
                    <p>The capital of the Palawan Province is Puerto Princesa, which is one of the cleanest cities in
                        the Philippines. Major
                        tourist destinations within the province include Coron (famous for its dive sites) and El Nido
                        (with a splendid karst
                        scenery).</p>

                                convince you that you are in the Maldives. The turquoise waters that gently lap Banol

                                especially when the sun is shining.</p>
